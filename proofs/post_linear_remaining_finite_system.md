# Post-linear remaining finite system

Date: 2026-05-31

This note packages the current endpoint of the post-linear reductions as an
explicit finite system.  It does not prove `[Resolution: A]` or construct
`[Resolution: B]`.  It records what a nonlinear survivor must now satisfy if
the finite-linear obstruction has already been ruled out.

## Input data

The remaining finite datum is a local interval

```text
I = (C, (A_c)_{c in C}, R_C, T)
```

where:

- `C` is a finite quotient colour set;
- each `A_c` is a finite fibre;
- `R_C` is in left rack convention, `R_C(a,b)=(a*b,a)`;
- `T_{a,b}:A_a x A_b -> A_{a*b} x A_a` is a finite bijective local row;
- the coloured YBE holds for all colour triples.

The datum must pass:

```text
nonlinear_overlap_obstruction_audit(I).status
  == exact_remaining_nonlinear_obstruction
```

That means it is local-minimal, semisplit-free, in the
`bi_free_universal_corridor_bottleneck`, with universal continuation seed
closure.

## Row-level finite alternatives

Apply:

```text
nonlinear_overlap_refinement_audit(I)
```

The executable classifier is:

```text
post_linear_remaining_finite_system_audit(I)
```

It returns a `PostLinearRemainingFiniteSystemAudit` with:

```text
system_name
finite_obstruction_data
remaining_obligations
```

Raw interval data reaches System K only if the real bottleneck ledger first
certifies the `bi_free_universal_corridor_bottleneck` target.  A caller may
mark `kink_completion_deficits_routed=True` only when an external supplied
certificate has routed the K-deficits to fixed detector data; then the same
finite recovery rows are classified as the downstream System U endpoint
problem.

For either System K or System U, the universal-continuation descent ledger is
made explicit by `proofs/universal_continuation_identity_routing.md`:

```text
universal_continuation_identity_lost_edges
universal_continuation_identity_unrouted_edges
universal_continuation_identity_routing_proved
```

These rows use the equality readout as the descent candidate and the identity
readout as the external routing ledger.  In the universal-continuation branch,
they list the exact original fibre edges whose endpoint witnesses are still
needed.

The supplied endpoint-witness checker for this exact ledger is recorded in
`proofs/universal_continuation_identity_endpoint_witness.md`.  It validates a
proposed fixed endpoint package against the identity-routed edge set and then
fits the generic descent-endpoint repair contract interface.

Every closed branch has already been routed out if the status is one of:

```text
closed_by_repair_contract
closed_by_transport_state_rackification
closed_by_locally_nondegenerate_branch
section_kernel_visible_to_existing_readouts
closed_by_product_triangular_collapse
latin_triangular_kink_contradiction
latin_triangular_kink_impossible
latin_triangular_ybe_projection_inconsistent
side_dual_latin_triangular_ybe_projection_inconsistent
side_dual_latin_triangular_kink_contradiction
side_dual_latin_triangular_kink_impossible
```

Thus a genuine remaining nonlinear finite system has one of exactly two
shapes.

## System K: kink-completion deficit

The first survivor shape is:

```text
status == triangular_recovery_kink_completion_deficit.
```

Equivalently:

```text
triangular_recovery_verified = True,
not all_triangular_rows_close_by_product,
not latin_triangular_kink_impossible,
rack_kink_completion_deficits != empty.
```

The finite deficit is not abstract.  It is one of:

```text
base_not_finite_rack
latin_rows_not_present_for_all_pairs
side_dual_latin_rows_present_for_all_pairs
latin_ybe_equations_not_verified
kink_cancellation_not_verified
```

together with the concrete rows:

```text
left_triangular_row_pairs
right_triangular_row_pairs
missing_left_latin_row_pairs
missing_right_latin_row_pairs
missing_left_latin_row_defects
missing_right_latin_row_defects
active_missing_left_latin_row_defects
active_missing_right_latin_row_defects
k_left_side_dual_replacement_rows
triangular_latin_defect_closure_rows
triangular_latin_defect_proper_closure_rows
triangular_latin_defect_universal_closure_rows
triangular_constant_map_non_surjective_rows
triangular_companion_kernel_rows
triangular_companion_nonbijective_without_constant_kernel_rows
triangular_hidden_nonunit_opposite_without_product_rows
triangular_constant_kernel_recovery_route_rows
triangular_constant_kernel_unrouted_universal_rows
missing_triangular_row_profiles
missing_triangular_partial_constant_rows
missing_triangular_partial_constant_mixed_unit_rows
missing_triangular_nonconstant_hidden_rows
missing_triangular_left_rack_section_cardinality_failures
missing_triangular_injective_non_surjective_rows
missing_triangular_profile_unclassified_rows
missing_triangular_left_rack_cardinality_proved
missing_triangular_coordinate_unit_routes
missing_triangular_coordinate_unit_mixed_rows
missing_triangular_coordinate_unit_unrouted_rows
missing_triangular_locally_nondegenerate_closed_branch
missing_triangular_partial_constant_closure_rows
missing_triangular_partial_constant_proper_closure_rows
missing_triangular_partial_constant_universal_closure_rows
missing_triangular_partial_constant_continuation_routes
missing_triangular_partial_constant_unrouted_continuation_rows
universal_continuation_identity_lost_edges
universal_continuation_identity_unrouted_edges
universal_continuation_identity_routing_proved
side_dual_latin_completion_available
latin_ybe_failure_triples.
side_dual_latin_ybe_failure_triples
```

The side-dual flag is important.  It separates a genuinely missing Latin
completion from the case where the right triangular Latin rows are present
for every colour pair but the left-handed rack-kink theorem has not yet been
transported across the side-opposite symmetry.  Such a row is still System K,
not System U, until that side-dual completion is supplied or routed by a fixed
detector certificate.

The side-dual replacement rows make this finite:

```text
k_left_side_dual_replacement_rows
```

lists, for each missing left pair, whether the right side is already Latin,
is triangular but non-Latin with explicit right defects, or has no right
triangular replacement with an explicit missing-row profile.

The side-dual equations are exposed by
`proofs/triangular_recovery_side_dual_completion.md` using
`side_opposite_local_interval(interval)`.  This converts right triangular rows
into left triangular rows for the purpose of the Latin YBE audit.  The
right-rack diagonal cancellation theorem in
`proofs/right_rack_kink_latin_triangular_cancellation.md` closes this subcase
when the side-dual Latin YBE equations hold.  Therefore a surviving K-dual
row must carry explicit side-dual alpha, middle, or endpoint YBE projection
failures.  The consistency note
`proofs/triangular_latin_ybe_projection_consistency.md` then closes those
projection-failure states for genuine coloured-YBE interval data.

Thus, after the current refinements, the only live K-subsystem is the
left-missing completion problem.  The exact finite ledger is recorded in
`proofs/triangular_k_left_defect_ledger.md`; its left-handed defect reasons
are:

```text
no_left_triangular_row
left_row_product_collapse
left_constant_map_not_bijective
left_constant_map_not_surjective
left_constant_map_proper_kernel
left_constant_map_universal_kernel
left_companion_sections_not_bijective
left_companion_sections_proper_kernel
left_companion_sections_constant
left_companion_sections_injective_non_surjective
left_opposite_sections_not_bijective
left_opposite_proper_kernel_visible
left_opposite_injective_non_surjective
left_opposite_hidden_nonunit_unclassified
side_dual_right_latin_available
side_dual_right_triangular_nonlatin
no_side_dual_right_latin_replacement
```

After product collapse, proper-kernel visibility,
injective-nonsurjective visibility, and side-dual Latin availability are
routed out, the live K-left subsystem is exactly the nonempty part of
`active_missing_left_latin_row_defects`:

```text
some required left Latin-unit triangular colour pair is missing,
there is no complete right/side-dual Latin replacement,
and the row has not already routed to product triangular collapse, proper
kernel readouts, or strand-continuing transport.
```

For any active row with an actual kernel edge, the closure rows split the
case further:

```text
triangular_latin_defect_proper_closure_rows != empty
```

contradicts local minimality, while

```text
triangular_latin_defect_universal_closure_rows
```

lists the exact universal seed edges that still need fixed detector routing.

The structural rows must be empty for genuine bijective triangular interval
data:

```text
triangular_constant_map_non_surjective_rows
triangular_companion_kernel_rows
triangular_companion_nonbijective_without_constant_kernel_rows
triangular_hidden_nonunit_opposite_without_product_rows
```

Nonempty structural rows are inconsistency certificates, not additional live
branches.

Finally, constant-map kernel rows are checked against the triangular recovery
table:

```text
triangular_constant_kernel_unrouted_universal_rows
```

must be empty before those constant-map kernel seeds can be routed onward to
System U.

For colour pairs with no triangular row on the missing side, the profile rows
separate proper-kernel visibility, injective-nonsurjective size/codomain
misses, coordinate-side unit rows, partial-constant hidden rank loss, and
nonconstant hidden rank loss.  In the post-linear rank-profile branch,
coordinate-side unit rows are routed by
`proofs/triangular_k_left_coordinate_unit_routing.md`: if every colour pair is
two-sided unit then the locally nondegenerate/guitar branch applies; otherwise
the one-sided unit row is mixed-unit context with the nonunit data on the
opposite side.  Nonconstant hidden rows are inconsistency certificates.
Injective-nonsurjective and unclassified profile rows are closed by
`proofs/triangular_k_left_rack_cardinality_closure.md`: in a left-rack-base
local interval, every relevant finite coordinate section has equal domain and
codomain size, and the remaining finite-map kernel split is exhaustive.
Partial-constant hidden rows are mixed-unit context-recovery rows: their
nonunit sections are constant and their remaining sections are units.  The
constant nonunit sections now have their own closure ledger in
`proofs/triangular_k_left_partial_constant_closure.md`: proper generated
closures contradict local minimality, while universal generated closures are
then routed by
`proofs/triangular_k_left_partial_constant_continuation_route.md` into the
universal continuation seed channel.

`proofs/universal_continuation_identity_endpoint_witness.md` gives the
supplied-certificate checker for the next endpoint layer: once endpoint
factors are supplied for the identity-routed lost edges, the executable audit
checks exact coverage and exposes the resulting endpoint-visibility certificate
to the repair-contract audit.

To close System K on the A side, prove that every such finite deficit either
cannot occur in a genuine local-minimal bi-free universal-corridor interval or
is visible in a fixed interval-level detector/readout.  To turn System K into
B, construct one explicit interval with such a deficit and upgrade the
resulting residual motion to a normalized-law sequence invisible to every
finite group.

## System U: triangular recovery unit endpoint

The second survivor shape is:

```text
status == triangular_recovery_unit_longitude_obstruction.
```

Here the finite recovery unit group

```text
U_tri = < triangular recovery row permutations >
```

is fixed by the interval.  A residual endpoint word in its generators must be
handled by one of the following finite certificate systems:

```text
triangular_recovery_detector_lift_transition_audit(...)
triangular_recovery_detector_lift_braid_audit(...)
triangular_recovery_longitude_expression_audit(...)
triangular_recovery_derived_series_lift_audit(...)
triangular_recovery_perfect_residual_audit(...)
triangular_recovery_longitude_route_audit(...)
```

To close System U on the A side, prove uniformly in braid index that every
triangular recovery endpoint lies in `V_beta(U_tri)`, by active detector-lift
rows, explicit endpoint-longitude expressions, derived-series lifts plus a
`P_tri` witness, or direct subgroup membership.

To turn System U into B, construct an explicit interval and a stable
perfect-residual finite miss in `P_tri` that upgrades to the normalized-law
residual sequence required by the local normalized-law fork.

## Equivalence to the current remaining problem

[Proved relative to the recorded branch reductions] After the finite-linear
overlap no-go theorem, any unresolved nonlinear primitive overlap must supply
a survivor of System K or System U.

Proof.  The obstruction audit localizes any survivor to a local-minimal
`bi_free_universal_corridor_bottleneck` interval.  The refinement audit then
routes strand-continuing, locally nondegenerate, proper-kernel, product
triangular, and rack-kink impossible/contradictory rows to closed branches.
If triangular recovery is not verified, the status is an earlier
constant-section or endpoint-recovery obstruction rather than a final
post-linear survivor.  Once triangular recovery is verified, either the
rack-kink completion deficits are nonempty, giving System K, or the recovery
unit observer is fixed and the endpoint is a System U unit-longitude problem.
These are exactly the two nonclosed statuses left by the current audit.
QED.

This equivalence does not itself solve the problem.  It is the current exact
finite target: close both finite systems uniformly to prove A, or construct
one explicit normalized-law counterexample from either system to prove B.
